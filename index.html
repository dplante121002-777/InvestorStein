Thanks for taking the time today, I’ll walk you through this clearly and directly.

Men’s and women’s vitality medicine is going through a major shift right now. The problem is that most of what people see online only addresses surface symptoms. What’s missing is a clinical, compliant approach that treats the real causes behind hormone decline, energy loss, intimacy challenges, and the emotional and physical disconnect that so many people quietly deal with.

That’s the gap we’re filling with MensRx and WomensRx.

For men, the decline usually begins silently in their thirties – testosterone drops, motivation and recovery slow, mood and confidence change.

For women, peri-menopause and menopause create hormonal swings, disrupted sleep, emotional strain, and often a major drop in desire and connection.

This isn’t vanity care. It’s identity care. People want to feel like themselves again.

          <h3>The Market Gap</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="card-tag">Why now</div>
      </div>
      <div class="script-block">
The market is clearly there – Hims, Hers, and others have already proven demand. But they operate mostly at the surface level: quick visits, simple prescriptions, and subscription refills.

What doesn’t exist yet in a meaningful way is a clinical vitality ecosystem that serves both men and women, with real hormone optimization, compounding options, provider-guided protocols, and a long-term relationship with the household.

That’s the lane we’re in with MensRx and WomensRx.

      <div class="script-block">
Let me give you thirty seconds on my background.

I’ve been in healthcare for more than thirty years, building and managing multi-state provider networks, telehealth systems, and pharmacy and compounding partnerships. My lane is combining vision with compliance – building things that are innovative, but also medically safe and scalable.

Back in 2017, long before the telehealth boom we’re seeing today, I secured the MensRx and WomensRx trademarks because I saw where the vitality and hormone space was heading. That early IP gives us a defensible brand position that most competitors simply don’t have.

So my role is simple: I run the medical vision and the compliance backbone, making sure everything we build is future-focused, clinically sound, and aligned with regulatory standards as we scale.

      <p class="inline-badge">Keep it simple here – men / women / household.</p>
      <div class="script-block">
Our solution is two connected platforms under one clinical vitality brand.

MensRx focuses on male vitality – testosterone optimization, peptides, libido and performance, energy, recovery, and emotional stability.

WomensRx focuses on peri-menopause and menopause – hormone balance, emotional regulation, desire and intimacy pathways, and personalized compounding where appropriate.

These are medically guided protocols. The simple goal on the patient side is: “I feel like myself again.”

    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <div class="label">Key Comparison</div>
      <p class="highlight">
        Glen should never say “we’re first” or deny Hims/Hers. He should position them as proof the market is big – and explain calmly why your model is deeper and more clinical.
      </p>

      <h3>Short Answer Glen Can Memorize</h3>
      <div class="script-block">
“Hims and Hers are great marketers. They’ve proven that the demand is there.

Where we’re different is that we’re building what they’re not set up to do – a clinically guided vitality ecosystem for both men and women, with hormone optimization, peptides, compounding, and longer-term protocols.

Their strength is convenience and simple prescriptions. Our strength is clinical depth, personalization, and outcomes.”
      </div>

      <h3>Why They Don’t Have Clinics – Glen’s Answer</h3>
      <div class="script-block">
“Clinics require a very different operational backbone – in-person provider oversight, lab monitoring, liability frameworks, and state-by-state clinical compliance.

Hims and Hers are structured for speed and simplicity. Their model is optimized for quick visits and scalable telehealth, not clinic infrastructure.

If they moved into clinics at scale, they’d be in a different business model entirely. That’s the space we’re designed for – a more regulated, medically intensive model that we can build safely around compliance and systems from day one.”

          A: They are, but at the surface level. Their model is built around convenience and simple prescriptions.
          We’re focused on clinical vitality – deeper protocols, hormone optimization, compounding, and long-term care for both men and women under one brand.

      <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="qa-q">Q: Why don’t Hims/Hers have physical clinics?</div>
        <div class="qa-a">
          A: Clinics require a different operational backbone – provider presence, monitoring, liability coverage, and heavier state regulation.
          Their business is optimized for speed and simplicity. Clinic infrastructure would slow them down and change their risk profile.
          Our model is designed to handle that level of compliance and oversight from day one.

          A: I’ve spent over thirty years building multi-state provider networks, telehealth systems, and pharmacy and compounding relationships.
          My lane is vision plus compliance – building something innovative in a way that’s medically safe and scalable.
          MensRx and WomensRx were trademarked back in 2017 because I saw early where this space was heading.

      <div class="qa-item">
        <div class="qa-q">Q: What’s the real moat here?</div>
        <div class="qa-a">
          A: Early IP, a compliance-first infrastructure, and dual-gender household capture.
          Once a household trusts us for both partners’ vitality care, the switching cost is very high and the lifetime value is strong.
        </div>

        <div class="qa-q">Q: What’s the biggest risk?</div>
        <div class="qa-a">
          A: The biggest risk is always scaling faster than the systems.
          That’s exactly why we’re building compliance and infrastructure as the backbone – not as an afterthought.
