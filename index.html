Thanks for taking the time today. I’ll keep this clear and direct.

Men’s and women’s vitality medicine is broken at a deeper level than most people realize. Men in their thirties and forties feel their energy, drive, and confidence drop. Women in peri-menopause and menopause go through hormonal swings, poor sleep, low desire, and emotional disconnect that affects their relationships, their work, and their overall quality of life.

This isn’t vanity care. It’s identity care. People don’t just want a pill – they want to feel like themselves again.

Hims and Hers and others have already proven that the demand is there. But they operate mostly at the surface level: quick visits, simple prescriptions, subscription refills. They’re optimized for speed and simplicity.

What doesn’t really exist yet is a clinical vitality ecosystem for both men and women – with hormone optimization, peptides, compounding when appropriate, and longer-term protocols guided by real providers, with a compliance-first backbone.

That’s the gap MensRx and WomensRx are built to fill.

My lane is vision plus compliance. I’ve spent more than thirty years in healthcare building multi-state provider networks, telehealth systems, and pharmacy and compounding partnerships. Back in 2017, long before the current telehealth wave, I secured the MensRx and WomensRx trademarks because I saw where this category was heading.

Our goal is to build the trusted clinical vitality brands for both men and women in the U.S., de-risk the model in the first 12 to 18 months, and position this as a platform that can either scale independently or be acquired once the economics are proven.

“The short answer is: this market is already huge and still underdeveloped.

You’ve got tens of millions of men and women in the U.S. alone dealing with hormone-related vitality issues – energy, mood, libido, sleep, and identity-level changes.

Hims and Hers have already taken this from ‘taboo’ to mainstream and built a multi-billion dollar company largely on the surface layer – quick visits, standardized treatment, and subscription refill logic.

We sit deeper than that. We’re focused on the clinical vitality layer: more personalized hormone programs, peptides, compounding when appropriate, and long-term household relationships for both men and women.

So we’re not trying to prove that people care about this. That’s already proven. We’re trying to build the clinical version that can coexist with, and eventually be highly attractive to, the larger telehealth players and PE roll-ups.”

“Hims and Hers are excellent marketers and operators. They’ve done a great job proving demand and normalizing this category.

Where we’re different is the depth of the model. Their machine is engineered for speed and simplicity: quick visits, standardized care paths, minimal friction.

We’re deliberately building for a different part of the curve – deeper clinical protocols for both men and women, with hormone optimization, peptides, compounding, and longer-term household care.

Clinics, lab monitoring, and advanced protocols require a different operational backbone – provider oversight, liability frameworks, and state-by-state compliance. Their system isn’t built for that kind of complexity. Ours is designed around it from day one.

So we don’t frame ourselves as ‘Hims but smaller.’ We frame ourselves as ‘the clinical vitality layer’ that sits deeper in the same universe.”

“At the consumer level, it’s simple:

MensRx helps men re-build energy, drive, and performance. WomensRx helps women navigate peri-menopause and menopause with better hormone balance, desire, sleep, and emotional stability.

Under the hood, that looks like:

• Telehealth consults with licensed providers
• Lab-informed protocols where appropriate
• Hormone optimization programs
• Peptides and related therapies where clinically appropriate
• Compounded formulations when standard approaches aren’t enough
• Long-term monitoring and follow-up instead of one-and-done scripts

The patient’s experience is: ‘I feel like myself again’ – but the engine making that possible is a clinical, compliance-driven infrastructure.”

• High potential for lifetime value if we execute on retention – especially when both partners in a household are on-platform

      <div class="label">Use of $250K – Simple Breakdown Glen Can Read</div>
      <div class="script-block">
“Here’s how your $250,000 actually gets used, especially now that we have a marketing partner investing alongside us.

Roughly:

• 35–40% – Clinical and compliance infrastructure  
  Providers, telehealth workflows, EHR and process, legal/compliance setup, and the basic operations we need to be safe and functional.

• 20–25% – Product, operations, and patient experience  
  MensRx and WomensRx digital properties, onboarding flows, scripting, basic patient support, and the systems that make this feel professional and trusted.

• 35–45% – Media spend and controlled acquisition  
  Actual ad spend and channel testing across search, social, and influencer distribution to bring in and retain our first several hundred paying patients on both the men’s and women’s sides.

The important point is this: our marketing and funnel build-out is not absorbing big retainers. Our marketing partner is willing to build and optimize funnels, creatives, and campaigns for a small equity/performance stake, so more of your capital goes into assets and media – not agency overhead.

The goal is to come out of that first phase with actual data: what it costs to acquire a patient, how long they stay, and what the contribution margin looks like. From there, we turn the dial up, refine the model, or, if the economics aren’t there, we don’t pretend otherwise.”

• Improve funnel performance and retention to support that higher CAC,
• Adjust pricing and packaging,
• Or stay disciplined and not force scale into bad unit economics.

I’d rather be honest that this is what we’re testing with your capital than promise fantasy CAC numbers and then disappoint you.”

“We do have a dedicated marketing partner that’s strong in direct-response, web build, and performance campaigns.

Instead of charging large upfront fees and retainers, they’re willing to take a small equity and performance-based position – essentially putting their time and expertise at risk alongside your capital.

Practically, that means the $250,000 you put in is not being chewed up by agency invoices. It’s funding clinical and operational infrastructure plus actual media spend and testing.

We’re also structuring the relationship so that the core brand and underlying patient relationships are controlled on our side. The partner is there to accelerate and optimize, not to own the core asset.”

Our initial go-to-market looks like:

• Influencer and expert partnerships – trusted voices in fitness, longevity, women’s health, and men’s performance.
• Education-driven content – simple, clear explanations of what’s actually happening to people’s bodies and what they can do about it.
• Referral loops – especially when both partners in a household are on-platform and getting results.

The marketing partner gives us the execution muscle to build and test these funnels quickly, but the strategy is still disciplined: small, controlled tests, double down on what works, and kill what doesn’t. The first 6–12 months are about finding the combinations of channel + message + offer that produce healthy acquisition and retention economics, not trying to blanket the internet overnight.”

That capital is earmarked for building out the clinical backbone, the brand and funnels for MensRx and WomensRx, and acquiring and retaining our first cohorts of patients on both sides so we can prove out real economics and decide how aggressively to scale.

Because our marketing partner is investing their time and expertise for a small equity/performance stake instead of big retainers, more of your $250,000 goes into infrastructure and actual media spend instead of agency fees.

What’s ahead of us – and what your capital funds – is turning that into an operating machine with real patients, real cohort data, and real unit economics. I’m not going to pretend we’re further along than we are. Your money takes this from a structurally sound plan to a live, measurable business.”

        <div class="qa-a">
Glen: “A realistic win is that you end up owning a significant piece of the clinical vitality leader for both men and women.

If we execute, this is a platform that can grow into an eight- or nine-figure revenue business and become a natural acquisition target for larger telehealth players or PE roll-ups who want the deeper clinical layer.

Your $250,000 puts you into that position before the numbers are obvious to everyone else.”

        <div class="qa-q">INVESTOR: “Why hasn’t someone deeper and better funded already done this and won?”</div>
        <div class="qa-a">
Glen: “Because doing deep clinical work at scale is hard.

Most strong clinical teams move slowly and don’t build great growth machines. Most great growth teams cut corners on the medical side to move fast.

Our advantage is that this is what I’ve done for decades – building provider networks, telehealth systems, and pharmacy relationships that can operate across states without tripping over compliance. That doesn’t guarantee success, but it does mean we’re not naive about the operational complexity here.”

        <div class="qa-a">
Glen: “Then we’ll call it what it is.

If we run the 12–18 month plan, follow the data, and the unit economics aren’t there – acquisition costs are too high, retention is too low – then your $250,000 bought clarity in a big category instead of returns.

I’d rather be upfront about that possibility than sell you a fantasy. The flip side is, if the numbers are good, you’re in early at a level that makes the upside meaningful.”

        <div class="qa-a">
Glen: “The space itself clearly has 10x and 20x potential – Hims and Hers proved that.

The question is whether our specific execution earns a meaningful slice of that.

We’re not promising a guaranteed 20x. We’re saying: this is a big, validated category where a clinical-depth, dual-gender, compliance-first player can be very valuable if we hit our milestones. If that risk-reward profile fits how you like to invest, then this is worth serious consideration.”

      <ul>
        <li><strong>“We’re the first…”</strong><br>

        <li><strong>Over-promising CAC or LTV numbers you don’t have.</strong><br>

“Let me pull this together for a second and bring it to a simple decision point.

We’re in a category that’s already been validated by players like Hims and Hers. The difference is that we’re building the clinical vitality layer – deeper protocols, dual-gender household care, and a compliance-first backbone that most growth-focused companies don’t want to deal with.

You understand my background in provider networks, telehealth, and pharmacy. You understand that the risk here is execution and unit economics, not whether people care about the problem.

The ask from you is $250,000 as the lead seed check.

That capital builds the spine – the clinical infrastructure, the brand and funnels, and the first real cohorts of patients on both the men’s and women’s sides so we can prove the model with actual data. Our marketing partner is investing their time and expertise for a small equity/performance stake instead of large retainers, so your capital is going toward infrastructure and media rather than agency overhead.

In return, you’re getting a meaningful equity position at an early-stage valuation, with the option to double down if we hit the milestones we’re laying out.

So the question is: does this fit the kind of risk-adjusted bet you like to make at this stage?

If it does, the next step is that I send over the term outline, we align on valuation and structure, and we move into docs and wiring details.

How are you feeling about moving forward at the $250,000 level as the lead investor?”

“Let me zoom out for a second and answer that clearly.”

“At a high level, the story is simple…” 

“The honest answer is: we don’t know that number yet. That’s exactly what the first 12–18 months with your capital are about proving.”

“The biggest risk here is execution, not demand – and I’d rather be upfront about that than oversell you.”

“If we see the economics aren’t working, we’re not going to force scale. We’ll adjust or we won’t push further capital into a bad model.”

“These are the kinds of disciplined decisions I’ve had to make in healthcare for decades – and that’s the same mindset I’m bringing here.”
