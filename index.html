        text: `Thanks for taking the time today. I’ll keep this tight and direct. Men’s and women’s vitality care is broken, underserved, and exploding in demand. We’re building the first dual-gender telehealth ecosystem designed to treat the real underlying issues, not just the surface symptoms.

This is a massive, hidden pain-point affecting tens of millions of people physically, emotionally, and relationally.

For men, the decline starts quietly in their thirties. Testosterone drops, energy tanks, mood shifts, recovery slows, and confidence slips. For women, peri-menopause and menopause bring hormonal chaos, emotional disconnect, low desire, sleep challenges, and intimacy issues that impact the entire household.

This is not a vanity problem. It’s an identity problem. People aren’t looking for a generic pill or a subscription gimmick. They want to feel like themselves again.

The vitality market is exploding but underdeveloped. There is no true category leader yet. Hims and Hers offer surface-level solutions. Legacy hormone clinics are outdated, inconvenient, and overpriced. Women’s vitality is almost entirely underserved.

Nobody has built a dual-gender, clinical, compliant, emotionally intelligent telehealth brand. We’re the first.

Let me introduce myself briefly. I bring over thirty years of healthcare experience, and my background sits at the intersection of vision and compliance. On the compliance side, I’ve built and managed multi-state provider networks, telehealth systems, and pharmacy and compounding partnerships. My specialty is creating the operational and regulatory frameworks that keep medical operations safe, legal, and scalable.

On the visionary side, I’ve always paid attention to where healthcare is moving, not where it’s been. Back in 2017, long before the telehealth boom, I secured the MensRx and WomensRx trademarks because I saw the shift coming in male and female vitality medicine. That early positioning gives us defensible intellectual property, a strong brand foundation, and a head start most companies simply don’t have.

My role is simple. I run the medical vision and the compliance backbone, ensuring everything we build is innovative, future-focused, and aligned with regulatory standards as we scale.

Our solution consists of two connected platforms. MensRx focuses on male vitality, hormones, energy, performance, and drive. WomensRx supports peri-menopause and menopause pathways, desire and intimacy, emotional health, and hormone balance.

We treat the root causes, not the superficial symptoms.

Our protocols use FDA-approved molecules, evidence-based compounding, and provider-guided pathways. Everything is structured around safety, personalization, and compliance. This is not a pill subscription company. This is a clinical vitality ecosystem.

Our competitive advantages are clear.

First, intellectual property ownership. We secured the MensRx and WomensRx trademarks back in 2017, giving us true early-mover advantage.

Second, compliance infrastructure. We build for scale, not shortcuts. Compliance is our backbone, not a footnote.

Third, dual-gender household capture. No other company covers both sides of the household under one trusted brand.

Our go-to-market model is built around direct-response content, influencer partnerships, user-generated content pipelines, search engine optimization, and search demand. This category has extremely high intent. People are actively looking for hormone, energy, and menopause solutions. We control our entire acquisition engine internally. There is no agency dependency. We build, test, and scale our own funnels.

We’re also building the MensRx Club and WomensRx Collective: high-trust communities that create emotional retention, accountability, transformation stories, and natural referrals. This dramatically reduces churn and increases subscription longevity.

Financially, this is a fifty to one hundred million dollar business within three to five years. We have high average order value, strong lifetime value, recurring subscription revenue, and gross margins between seventy and eighty-five percent. Growth expands through protocol additions, weight loss programs, peptides, hair optimization, and full household capture.

Strategically, we are a direct acquisition target for Hims, Hers, Ro, and private equity healthcare rollups. Or we scale independently well past one hundred million. If you pass today, you will see MensRx and WomensRx dominating this category within the next three years.

Thank you.`

For men, testosterone and motivation drop. For women, peri-menopause and menopause create hormonal chaos, low desire, and emotional disconnect. This isn’t vanity. It’s identity.

There’s no category leader. Hims and Hers are surface-level. Legacy hormone clinics are outdated. Women’s vitality is almost completely ignored. We’re the first clinical, compliant, emotionally intelligent, dual-gender brand.

I bring over thirty years of healthcare experience, specializing in provider networks, telehealth systems, and compounding partnerships. And back in 2017, long before telehealth surged, I secured the MensRx and WomensRx trademarks. That early IP gives us real defensibility.

Our solution: MensRx for male vitality, performance, and energy. WomensRx for hormone balance, desire, and emotional pathways. We treat root causes with FDA-approved molecules, evidence-based compounding, and provider-guided protocols.

Three advantages: our 2017 trademarks, our compliance-first infrastructure, and dual-gender household capture.

Our growth engine uses direct-response content, influencers, user-generated content, SEO, and high-intent search. We control acquisition internally with no agency dependency.

This becomes a fifty to one hundred million dollar business in three to five years with strong margins and long-term retention driven by the MensRx Club and WomensRx Collective.

This is a clinical vitality ecosystem, not a subscription pill company. If you pass, you’ll see MensRx and WomensRx owning this category within three years.

        text: `Quick answers for hard interruptions:

Does Hims and Hers do this?
No. They’re surface-level. We’re clinical-level.

Why hasn’t anyone already won this category?
Because it requires both medical credibility and compliant scaling. Most teams only have one.

What’s your moat?
MensRx and WomensRx trademarks from 2017, our compliance architecture, and dual-gender household capture.

Why you?
I’ve built provider networks, telehealth systems, pharmacy partnerships, and multi-state compliance frameworks for more than thirty years.

What’s the biggest risk?
Scaling too fast without proper compliance, which is exactly why compliance is our backbone.

What’s the exit?
Hims, Hers, Ro, or PE roll-ups. Or we scale past a hundred million independently.

What makes this urgent?
Women’s vitality is exploding in demand and totally underserved. Whoever gets there first owns the space.

What makes this safe?
FDA-approved molecules, evidence-based compounding, and provider-guided protocols.

What makes this valuable?
High average order value, strong lifetime value, recurring revenue, and seventy to eighty-five percent margins.

What makes this real?
We already secured the trademarks, the clinical model, and the infrastructure.

Bottom line:
We’re building the category leader. If you wait, someone else takes this.`
